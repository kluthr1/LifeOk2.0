Our hack is to create a computer and mobile-friendly website where a patient is able to write daily diary entries which would be sent straight to their therapist.
We made this website using javascript and html. Originally we planned on making an Android App, and then using flask but these led to some limitations so we took our concepts from our python-flask program and inputed them into a new repository that was all based with php/javascript/html. We also used bootstrap to help with UI.

This allows for those suffering from mental related syndroms to express their feelings to Lil' Boat without always being worried that people are judging. Lil' Boat shares all this information with his/her therapist(With their permission) allowing for better, and faster help. People express themselves on any of their devices without being worried about how others view them.
